# DPCAC: Effective Multi-scale Graph Contrastive Learning via Dual-Perspective Clustering and Adaptive Contrast [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705125012882?via%3Dihub]

DPCAC is a self-supervised graph representation learning framework that integrates dual-perspective graph abstraction and stratified similarity-weighted contrastive learning. It is designed to extract expressive node embeddings from unlabeled graph-structured data by combining structural and feature-based semantics with adaptive negative sample differentiation.
